A wooden grate is affixed into the wall.

A bright light descends between the houses with a great roar - you yell out in fear as you realize the gun-ship has you cornered!

Sharp pain shoots up from your left hand.

Charnel Pit
You are up against the edge of the pit, a barely curving wall of slimy gray brickwork. A morass of bones and rotting flesh crunch underfoot - enormous piles of corpses loom over you from all sides that is not the wall.

A wooden grate is affixed into the wall.

A donkey cart full of naked, emaciated corpses arrive by the rim of the pit. As the cart tilts backward they fall first en masse, then one by one into the deep gulf.

The great bell of the Palace rings out into the night.

The rotting wood finally gives way, creating an opening for escape!

Symmetric Alley
A long alley, or road, flanked by perfectly symmetrical houses down to the seaside docks. Behind you is a gray brick wall.

A wooden grate is affixed into the wall.

A bright light descends between the houses with a great roar - you yell out in fear as you realize the gun-ship has you cornered!

Sharp pain shoots up from your left hand.

Warsaw Grand Square
Here lies the great corpse-pit, a vast gulf of darkness fifty meters across encircled by the pavement of the Grand Square. Men in long black coats stand haggling in booths and by carts all around. The clock of the Palace reads midnight.

Symmetric Alley
A long alley, or road, flanked by perfectly symmetrical houses down to the seaside docks. Behind you is a gray brick wall.

A wooden grate is affixed into the wall.

A donkey cart full of naked, emaciated corpses arrive by the rim of the pit. As the cart tilts backward they fall first en masse, then one by one into the deep gulf.

The great bell of the Palace rings out into the night.

A donkey cart full of naked, emaciated corpses arrive by the rim of the pit. As the cart tilts backward they fall first en masse, then one by one into the deep gulf.

The great bell of the Palace rings out into the night.

Symmetric Alley
A long alley, or road, flanked by perfectly symmetrical houses down to the seaside docks. Behind you is a gray brick wall.

A wooden grate is affixed into the wall.

A bright light descends between the houses with a great roar - you yell out in fear as you realize the gun-ship has you cornered!

Warsaw Grand Square
Here lies the great corpse-pit, a vast gulf of darkness fifty meters across encircled by the pavement of the Grand Square. Men in long black coats stand haggling in booths and by carts all around. The clock of the Palace reads midnight.

A human skull catches your shoulder hard and the rest of your body slams into the top of a mountain of corpses. Down and down and down you tumble, coming to rest against the wall of the pit.

Charnel Pit
You are up against the edge of the pit, a barely curving wall of slimy gray brickwork. A morass of bones and rotting flesh crunch underfoot - enormous piles of corpses loom over you from all sides that is not the wall.

A wooden grate is affixed into the wall.

Symmetric Alley
A long alley, or road, flanked by perfectly symmetrical houses down to the seaside docks. Behind you is a gray brick wall.

A wooden grate is affixed into the wall.

A bright light descends between the houses with a great roar - you yell out in fear as you realize the gun-ship has you cornered!

A human skull catches your shoulder hard and the rest of your body slams into the top of a mountain of corpses. Down and down and down you tumble, coming to rest against the wall of the pit.

Charnel Pit
You are up against the edge of the pit, a barely curving wall of slimy gray brickwork. A morass of bones and rotting flesh crunch underfoot - enormous piles of corpses loom over you from all sides that is not the wall.

A wooden grate is affixed into the wall.

The rotting wood finally gives way, creating an opening for escape!

Symmetric Alley
A long alley, or road, flanked by perfectly symmetrical houses down to the seaside docks. Behind you is a gray brick wall.

A wooden grate is affixed into the wall.

A bright light descends between the houses with a great roar - you yell out in fear as you realize the gun-ship has you cornered!

Sharp pain shoots up from your left hand.

Warsaw Grand Square
Here lies the great corpse-pit, a vast gulf of darkness fifty meters across encircled by the pavement of the Grand Square. Men in long black coats stand haggling in booths and by carts all around. The clock of the Palace reads midnight.

Symmetric Alley
A long alley, or road, flanked by perfectly symmetrical houses down to the seaside docks. Behind you is a gray brick wall.

A wooden grate is affixed into the wall.

A bright light descends between the houses with a great roar - you yell out in fear as you realize the gun-ship has you cornered!

Sharp pain shoots up from your left hand.

Charnel Pit
You are up against the edge of the pit, a barely curving wall of slimy gray brickwork. A morass of bones and rotting flesh crunch underfoot - enormous piles of corpses loom over you from all sides that is not the wall.

A wooden grate is affixed into the wall.

The rotting wood finally gives way, creating an opening for escape!

Symmetric Alley
A long alley, or road, flanked by perfectly symmetrical houses down to the seaside docks. Behind you is a gray brick wall.

A wooden grate is affixed into the wall.

A bright light descends between the houses with a great roar - you yell out in fear as you realize the gun-ship has you cornered!

Sharp pain shoots up from your left hand.

    <result xml:space="preserve">You take a few steps back and launch yourself into a running jump over the edge. You fall and fall and fall for what seems like several minutes.

A human skull catches your shoulder hard and the rest of your body slams into the top of a mountain of corpses. Down and down and down you tumble, coming to rest against the wall of the pit.

Charnel Pit
You are up against the edge of the pit, a barely curving wall of slimy gray brickwork. A morass of bones and rotting flesh crunch underfoot - enormous piles of corpses loom over you from all sides that is not the wall.

A wooden grate is affixed into the wall.

The rotting wood finally gives way, creating an opening for escape!

Symmetric Alley
A long alley, or road, flanked by perfectly symmetrical houses down to the seaside docks. Behind you is a gray brick wall.

A wooden grate is affixed into the wall.

A bright light descends between the houses with a great roar - you yell out in fear as you realize the gun-ship has you cornered!

Sharp pain shoots up from your left hand.

A naked light-bulb illuminates some shelving containing cleaning supplies and other, less identifiable things. The door to the west has been torn open, the wood in the frame splintered.
